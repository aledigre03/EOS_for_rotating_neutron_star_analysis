# EOS_for_rotating_neutron_star_analysis
The repository contains programs that implement the algorithms developed by Read et al. and Greif et al. for a piecewise polytropic EOS and a speed of sound parametrization EOS. Also, it contains some codes I used to analyze the output of the program rns from Stergioulas.
